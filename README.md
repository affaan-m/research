Below is an overview of the current projects and their corresponding descriptions.

## Research Project 1: Discovering Market Manipulation Using Sentiment Analysis in Microcap Cryptocurrencies

### Overview

This project aims to explore the relationship between Reddit discussions and the price movements of microcap cryptocurrencies. Leveraging various APIs, including CoinMarketCap, Twitter, and Reddit, the study focuses on identifying correlations, understanding sentiment, and attempting to infer causality.

### Methodology

The project follows a systematic approach, divided into multiple steps:

1. **Sample Selection**: Selecting 500 microcap cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of under 1 million USD.
2. **Data Collection**: Gathering mentions from Reddit posts and constructing a rich dataset.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and aggregating the data, including sentiment analysis.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating linear relationships between post counts and price.
5. **Statistical Significance Testing**: Confirming the statistical significance of the correlations.
6. **Multivariate Regression Analysis**: Conducting a panel data regression model to understand influences on price, including lagged price, Reddit posts, and total market cap.

### Findings

- **Positive Sentiment**: An overwhelmingly positive sentiment across the posts.
- **Strong Correlations**: A few microcaps showed strong positive correlations between Reddit discussions and price.
- **Statistical Significance**: The significant correlations suggest potential underlying relationships.

### Limitations and Future Work

- **Model Complexity**: A more complex model could refine insights.
- **Data Scope**: Additional data sources and variables may enhance the analysis.
- **Focused Analysis**: Further studies could explore the mechanisms driving specific correlations.

### Conclusion

This project offers valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between social media and financial markets, particularly within the realm of microcap cryptocurrencies. It serves as a foundation for further research and innovation in the field of financial technology and market behavior.
